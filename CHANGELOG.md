# Unreleased

## Added

* Added `dstore.OpenObject` that is able to open a single store element without having to create a separate store, this is a shortcut for splitting the path & filename, creating a new store from the path and then calling `store.OpenObject`.

## Changed

* The `dstore.NewLocalStore` (local store implementation) sanitize the input if it does not start with `file://`.
